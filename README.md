## German Traffic Sign Detection
**Assignment work done as part of Udemy Self-Driving Car Course**

This project builds a Convolutional Neural Network that is trained on 43 different classes of traffic sign images. These kinds of classifiers built on large-scale data can be used for self-driving cars to recognize and classify traffic signs on the fly and make quick decisions - such as speed up or slow down, stop when it comes across a stop sign etc. 

The model was trained on ~35k color images of traffic signs and was test metrics were evaluated using ~12k images. In addition, you can also add a URL to an image and classify that. The output would look something like:
